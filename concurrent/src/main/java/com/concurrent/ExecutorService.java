/**
 * An {@link com.concurrent.Executor} that provides methods to manage termination and
 * methods that can produce a {@link com.concurrent.Future} for tracking progress of
 * one or more asynchronous tasks.
 * 一个Executor,其提供了一系列管理中断的方法以及一系列生产出用以追踪一个或多个异步任务过程的Future对象的方法
 * <p>An {@code ExecutorService} can be shut down, which will cause
 * it to reject new tasks.  Two different methods are provided for
 * shutting down an {@code ExecutorService}. The {@link #shutdown}
 * method will allow previously submitted tasks to execute before
 * terminating, while the {@link #shutdownNow} method prevents waiting
 * tasks from starting and attempts to stop currently executing tasks.
 * Upon termination, an executor has no tasks actively executing, no
 * tasks awaiting execution, and no new tasks can be submitted.  An
 * unused {@code ExecutorService} should be shut down to allow
 * reclamation of its resources.
 * 一个ExecutorService能够被关闭，以此使之拒绝新的任务。ExecutorService提供两个不同的方法用以实现关闭。
 * {@link #shutdown}方法将允许在中止之前，将已提交的任务执行，而{@link #shutdownNow}方法阻止等待任务开始，
 * 并试图停止当前正在执行的任务。当中止的时候，一个executor没有正在执行的任务，没有任务等待执行，没有新的任务
 * 能够被提交。一个未使用的ExecutorService应该被关闭以允许它的资源被回收
 * <p>Method {@code submit} extends base method {@link
 * com.concurrent.Executor#execute} by creating and returning a {@link com.concurrent.Future} that
 * can be used to cancel execution and/or wait for completion.
 * Methods {@code invokeAny} and {@code invokeAll} perform the most
 * commonly useful forms of bulk(体积庞大的） execution, executing a collection of
 * tasks and then waiting for at least one, or all, to
 * complete. (Class {@link ExecutorCompletionService} can be used to
 * write customized（定制的） variants（变异的） of these methods.)
 * {@code submit}方法继承于{@link Executor#execute(Runnable)}方法，并且能够创建和返回一个Future对象，
 * 此Future对象被用来取消操作或者等待计算。{@code invokeAny}和{@code invokeAll}方法表示了大任务最常用的执行方式。
 * 包括任务集合的执行，等待一个或全部任务完成。
 * <p>The {@link com.concurrent.Executors} class provides factory methods for the
 * executor services provided in this package.
 *
 * <h3>Usage Examples</h3>
 *
 * Here is a sketch of a network service in which threads in a thread
 * pool service incoming requests. It uses the preconfigured {@link
 * com.concurrent.Executors#newFixedThreadPool} factory method:
 *
 *  <pre> {@code
 * class NetworkService implements Runnable {
 *   private final ServerSocket serverSocket;
 *   private final ExecutorService pool;
 *
 *   public NetworkService(int port, int poolSize)
 *       throws IOException {
 *     serverSocket = new ServerSocket(port);
 *     pool = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(poolSize);
 *   }
 *
 *   public void run() { // run the service
 *     try {
 *       for (;;) {
 *         pool.execute(new Handler(serverSocket.accept()));
 *       }
 *     } catch (IOException ex) {
 *       pool.shutdown();
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * class Handler implements Runnable {
 *   private final Socket socket;
 *   Handler(Socket socket) { this.socket = socket; }
 *   public void run() {
 *     // read and service request on socket
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * The following method shuts down an {@code ExecutorService} in two phases,
 * first by calling {@code shutdown} to reject incoming tasks, and then
 * calling {@code shutdownNow}, if necessary, to cancel any lingering tasks:
 *
 *  <pre> {@code
 * void shutdownAndAwaitTermination(ExecutorService pool) {
 *   pool.shutdown(); // Disable new tasks from being submitted
 *   try {
 *     // Wait a while for existing tasks to terminate
 *     if (!pool.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
 *       pool.shutdownNow(); // Cancel currently executing tasks
 *       // Wait a while for tasks to respond to being cancelled
 *       if (!pool.awaitTermination(60, TimeUnit.SECONDS))
 *           System.err.println("Pool did not terminate");
 *     }
 *   } catch (InterruptedException ie) {
 *     // (Re-)Cancel if current thread also interrupted
 *     pool.shutdownNow();
 *     // Preserve interrupt status
 *     Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * <p>Memory consistency effects: Actions in a thread prior to the
 * submission of a {@code Runnable} or {@code Callable} task to an
 * {@code ExecutorService}
 * <a href="package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility"><i>happen-before</i></a>
 * any actions taken by that task, which in turn <i>happen-before</i> the
 * result is retrieved via {@code Future.get()}.
 *
 * @since 1.5
