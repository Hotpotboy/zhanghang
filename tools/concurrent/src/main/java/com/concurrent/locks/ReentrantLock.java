/**
 * A reentrant mutual exclusion {@link com.concurrent.locks.Lock} with the same basic
 * behavior and semantics（语义） as the implicit（内含的） monitor lock accessed using
 * {@code synchronized} methods and statements, but with extended（扩展）
 * capabilities.
 * 与使用synchronized方法和语句相关的内含监控锁相比，一个重入互斥锁具有相同的基本行为与语义，但是
 * 重入互斥锁有更多的扩展能力。
 * <p>A {@code ReentrantLock} is <em>owned</em> by the thread last
 * successfully locking, but not yet unlocking it. A thread invoking
 * {@code lock} will return, successfully acquiring the lock, when
 * the lock is not owned by another thread. The method will return
 * immediately if the current thread already owns the lock. This can
 * be checked using methods {@link #isHeldByCurrentThread}, and {@link
 * #getHoldCount}.
 * 一个重入锁被最后一个成功锁住，但没有释放的线程所持有。一个线程调用{@link #lock()}方法，
 * 如果此锁没有被其他线程拥有，则调用此方法将成功持有此锁。如果当前线程成功持有锁，该方法将会立即返回。
 * 通过方法{@link #isHeldByCurrentThread}和方法{@link #getHoldCount}来检查当前线程持有锁的相关情况
 * <p>The constructor for this class accepts an optional
 * <em>fairness</em> parameter.  When set {@code true}, under
 * contention, locks favor granting access to the longest-waiting
 * thread.  Otherwise this lock does not guarantee any particular
 * access order.  Programs using fair locks accessed by many threads
 * may display lower overall throughput (i.e., are slower; often much
 * slower) than those using the default setting, but have smaller
 * variances（差异） in times to obtain locks and guarantee lack of
 * starvation（饥饿）. Note however, that fairness of locks does not guarantee
 * fairness of thread scheduling. Thus, one of many threads using a
 * fair lock may obtain it multiple times in succession while other
 * active threads are not progressing and not currently holding the
 * lock.
 * Also note that the untimed {@link #tryLock()} method does not
 * honor the fairness setting. It will succeed if the lock
 * is available even if other threads are waiting.
 * 此类的构造器接收一个表示公布性的参数。当此参数为true，则在这种情况下，会将锁授予给
 * 等待了最长事件的线程。否则，此锁不会指定任何特别的访问顺序。被多个线程访问，使用公平锁的程序
 * 可能呈现出更低的整体吞吐量，相对于使用默认设置的程序而言；但在获取锁和保障缺乏饥饿的时候，会有更小的差异。
 * 此外需要注意，锁的公平性并不保障线程调度的公平性。因此，使用了一个公平锁的多个线程中的一个可能会连续不到的
 * 多吃获取同一个锁，而其他活跃的线程却不能持有次锁。另需注意的是，不定时的{@link #tryLock()}方法不会遵从
 * 设定的公平性。此方法将返回成功，如果此锁可用（计时其他线程正在等待）。
 * <p>It is recommended practice to <em>always</em> immediately
 * follow a call to {@code lock} with a {@code try} block, most
 * typically（通常） in a before/after construction such as:
 *
 *  <pre> {@code
 * class X {
 *   private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
 *   // ...
 *
 *   public void m() {
 *     lock.lock();  // block until condition holds
 *     try {
 *       // ... method body
 *     } finally {
 *       lock.unlock()
 *     }
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * <p>In addition to implementing the {@link com.concurrent.locks.Lock} interface, this
 * class defines a number of {@code public} and {@code protected}
 * methods for inspecting the state of the lock.  Some of these
 * methods are only useful for instrumentation and monitoring.
 * 除了实现{@link com.concurrent.locks.Lock}接口，此类还定义了一些列公共、保护的方法，
 * 来检测锁的状态。这些方法中的一些只对管理和监控有用
 * <p>Serialization of this class behaves in the same way as built-in
 * locks: a deserialized lock is in the unlocked state, regardless of
 * its state when serialized.
 *
 * <p>This lock supports a maximum of 2147483647 recursive（递归） locks by
 * the same thread. Attempts to exceed this limit result in
 * {@link Error} throws from locking methods.
